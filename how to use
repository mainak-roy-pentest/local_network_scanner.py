- To scan specific ports:
    ```
    python local_network_scanner.py --range 192.168.1.0/24 --ports 22,80,445
    ```

- For detailed vulnerability checks using Nmap:
    ```
    python local_network_scanner.py --range 192.168.1.0/24 --nmap
    ```

## Output

- For each device: shows IP, MAC, open ports, and basic vulnerability notes.
- If `--nmap` is used and Nmap is installed, detailed script-based vulnerability results are provided.

## Notes

- Run with administrative/root privileges for best results.
- **Scan only networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal.**
- The built-in vulnerability check highlights common weaknesses but is not exhaustive.

## Disclaimer

This tool is for educational and authorized security testing on your own networks.
